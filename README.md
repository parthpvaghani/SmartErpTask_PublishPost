This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

This Task - I would say this is not an optimized solution in case of storybook and testing but somehow I have managed it using my technical and reference searching skills as an Entry-level with react.

Functionality wise it works properly as mentioned and added extra features with this react app like #Toggleview + ResponsiveOn Mobile Device.

By initial support and guidance, I can implement this even in a better way!

### `npm start`
